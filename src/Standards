				Standards for storing data in files
				
	In order for our application to run smoother and for the FileParser classes to execute faster, 
	please have a toString() method in each class, whose data will need to be stored. The fields of
	the Class to be stored should be separated by colons, with no spaces, and should be stored
	in the same exact order that the Class is instantiated.
	
	For example: 
	
	public class Expense
	{
	
		private double amount;			// The amount of the Expense
	
		private Date transactionDate;	// The Date the Expense was made
	
		private String item;			// description of the item bought
		
		
		//constructor
		public class Expense(String className, double amount, Date date, String item);
		
		//toString method to use to store the data in file
		public String toString()
		{
		return (String.format("%s:%f:%s:%s", this.getClassName(),this.getAmmount(), 
				this.getDate().toString(), this.getItem()));
		}
	}
	
	Notice that double values are stored as is and are not formatted in any way;
	using a .2f% or .10%f format specifier is not okay in this instance.
	
	Also notice that the Date object stored in the Expense has a toString() method
	that returns the the string representation of the object as it should be represented
	in the expense.
	
	Once completing the toString(), notify the team lead that the class has had a toString()
	implemented so he can update the FileParsers accordingly.
